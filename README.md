This was my first time using MATLAB as a tool in designing behavioral experiments. I was the sole programmer and learned the importance of test-driven development. I made a minor mistake in the code that resulted in a signficant imbalance in condition assignment, which made data analysis tricky. The mistake? I treated a string variable as a number. #TDDUntilIDie
